Our project is a website named "Yale Study Spots" that has the purpose of introducing the user to various popular study spots on campus. You can navigate various spots by clicking on tabs of the navigation bar near the top of the page. Another way you can navigate to the pages of different study spots is by clicking on the red dots on the interactive map on the home page.

The home page features a Yale campus map with red dots labeling the relative locations of each study spot that we chose. One of the special features of the homoepage is that you can choose to review any of the chosen study spots. This gives you some user interaction with our webiste. When you click on the button "Review a Study Spot", a dropdown menu with options, a textbox for your review, and a submit button will appear. When you click on the submit button, your review will be posted on the page of the specific spot that you chose. Your review is anonymous and will stay on the on the page of the specific spot you chose.


The other tabs all feature popular Yale study spots. Each has a photo of the spot and a caption. Below the photo describes the opening hours and address of each spot. User reviews are also posted on the right hand side of each page.
