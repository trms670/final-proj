Our project is a website named "Yale Study Spots" that has the purpose of introducing the user to various popular study spots on campus. You can navigate various spots by clicking on tabs of the navigation bar near the top of the page. Another way you can navigate to the pages of different study spots is by clicking on the red dots on the interactive map on the home page.

The home page features a Yale campus map with red dots labeling the relative locations of each study spot that we chose. Please click on the red dots to try the interactive map feature.

The other tabs all showcase popular Yale study spots. Each has a photo of the spot and a caption. Below the photo describes the opening hours and address of each spot. The address is linked so that when the user clicks on it, the website redirects to Google maps with the address pasted in as a destination. 

A special feature on each tab of a specific spot is that the user can review that spot so that their review is posted onto the website. To do so, click on "Review this spot" button. Then a textbox and "submit" button should appear. The user should write their review in the textbox and then click the "submit" button to see their review posted onto the webiste.
