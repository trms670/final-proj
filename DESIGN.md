# final-proj

Our first step in the implementation process was to create the html and styles.css pages for each the homepage and each study spot. This served as a base for us to envision what the website would look like. 
We designed the homepage structure on index.html, using styles.css to design the headers, buttons, images and image captions. Also in index.html, we created a navigation bar using a bootstrap "container-fluid" feature and designed it in styles.css. Originally, we were thinking of implementing a feature in which we would create an interactive map that would have clickable locations on the map, so that when the user clicked on a location, they would be redirected to the html page of the spot that they clicked on. However, we diverted from this plan because we thought navigatiing a map might be too difficult for the user. They might not be familiar with the Yale campus and reading the map would take too much effort. So instead we decdied to use a navigation bar because it would be easier for the user to directly go to a specific page. 
For the "Review a Study Spot" button, we used a feature in JavaScript to hide the dropdown menu, textbox, and "submit" button and show those elements only when that the "Review a Study Spot" button is clicked.
