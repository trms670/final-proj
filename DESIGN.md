# final-proj

Our first step in the implementation process was to create the html and styles.css pages for each the homepage and each study spot. This served as a base for us to envision what the website would look like. 
We designed the homepage structure on index.html, using styles.css to design the headers, buttons, images and image captions. Also in index.html, we created a navigation bar using a bootstrap "container-fluid" feature and designed it in styles.css. Another feature of the homepage that does this same function is the interactive map, which redirects users to the page of the specific spot that click on. We thought that an interactive map would be more fun for the user and give users an idea of the relative location of a certain spot on the Yale campus.

For the "Review a Study Spot" button, we used a feature in JavaScript to hide the dropdown menu, textbox, and "submit" button and show those elements only when that the "Review a Study Spot" button is clicked. 
One area that we struggled with was implementing flask in VScode so that a user's review is posted onto the page of the specific study spot.
